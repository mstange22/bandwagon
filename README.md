First Group Project - BandWagon

Deployed site: https://mstange22.github.io/project-1/

This is our first group project.  Requirements were to build an app, using data from at least 2 APIs.  We chose Wikipedia and SoudCloud.

The general concept is that users select a musical band or artist and view related facts and listen to SoundCloud tracks.

We use Firebase to store 5 presets.  Users can add bands/artists and they are added to the navbar buttons, overwriting presets, but just for their session.  The original pre-sets are refreshed on page load.

Future functionality may be to tie into Spotify so that we can access a larger collection of tracks and display complete discographies of each band or artist.
