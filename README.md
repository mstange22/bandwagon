Group Project - BandWagon

Requirements included building an app using data from 2 APIs.  We chose Wikipedia and SoudCloud.  Use a technology not yet presented in class materials.  We used Skeleton for the CSS framework.  Polished front end.  Check!  Error checking / input validation?  It's pretty robust.  Good coding standards: indentation, scoping, naming.  I think we're good there.  No pop-up "alerts", "prompts", or confirms.  Check out our modals!  Mobile responsive. 

The general concept is that users select a musical band or artist and view related facts and listen to SoundCloud tracks.

We use Firebase to store up to 5 presets.  Session users can then add bands/artists and they are added to the navbar buttons, overwriting presets, but just for their session.  Original pre-sets are refreshed on page load.

Future functionality may be to tie into Spotify (our first choice) so that we can access a larger collection of tracks and display complete discographies of each band or artist.  We could also use Amazon and create "Buy Now" links for track / album purchases.

Another idea that was suggested is to have the presets loaded with trending artists so that users can listen to hot tracks immediately.
